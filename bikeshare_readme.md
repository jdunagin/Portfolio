## Overview
This project uses data from Capital Bikeshare in Washington DC to predict the demand for the bikeshare service.

## Data
The data was aquired from the UCI Machine learning library. The data set is a time series containing the number of bike renatals every hour for a two year period. It also contains information about the date, time, weather, and other attributes.

## Methods
This data was modeled to predict the seasonal and cyclical factors affecting the demand for bikeshare. There was a general trend of increasing demand, which was corrected for. Then, regression techniques were employed to predict the demand. The end result is a model that inputs date, time, and the other feautres in the data set then outputs predicted demand.
