# Overview
This project was an exploratory data analysis on fantasy football data. Specifically, I looked at the performance of running backs to better understand what makes the good ones successful. The reason for this is that running backs are generally the most valuable position in the popular format of FF.

# Data
This data was pulled from Pro-Football-Reference.com. This contains raw player data from the 2021 NFL season.

# Methods
The first thing I did was convert the raw data into fantasy-relevant metrics. This included fantasy points, yards, touchdowns, and usage. I looked at how these variables were distributed, then split up players by one of these metrics. A hypothesis test and simple regressions were done to look at the strength of the relationship between variables.
