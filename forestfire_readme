# Overview
The goal of this project was to look at data related to forest fires. Broadly, I wanted to explore what factors were related to the size of these fires.

# Data
This data came from the UCI machine learning library. It contained information about the size of fires, as well as when they were and several environmental conditions that could affect the fire. All of these fires were in Northeast Portugal.

# Methods
First, there was an exploratory analysis done to see how fire size was distributed. This gave insight into what kind of relationship might exist between variables. I then grouped some statistics based on time of the year, expecting to see seasonal trends in wildfire size/frequency. Finally, I did a few basic linear regressions on the size of the fire and a couple common indexes from the Fire Weather Index System.
