## Overview
The goal of this project is to combine several sources of data into one data set. In particular, I combine different sources about satellites in orbit.

## Data Sources
Three different sources are used here. One comes from a CSV file I downloaded, one comes from web-scraped data set, and the other comes from an API.

## Methods
Once the data sets are received, they are cleaned by transforming some variables and removing others. Datasets are joined by a common 'NORAD Number'. This is an identifier used by various space agencies to uniquely identify each satellite.
