# Overview
This project looks at data from fantasy football drafts, and compares them to player performance in that season. The motivation for this project is to understand how draft rank within each football position relates to how many points they score throughout the season. This relates to questions such as, when should you draft one position instead of another?

# Data
The data comes from fantasyfootballcalculator.com and Pro-Football-Reference.com. For the former, I use an API to get data. For the latter, I download a csv.

# Methods
After loading the data, I clean and combine the data sets. This gives me a final data set with attributes about each player's draft ranking and performance in the season. Then, I make some visualizations showing roughly how valuable players are, given their draft rank and position.
